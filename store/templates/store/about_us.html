    <h1>About Us:</h1>
    <p>We're passionate about wine, and know many of our customers feel the same way. So we are committed to offering
        the nation's best wine selection, with an emphasis on fine wines. Our typical store carries more than 8,000
        different wines from every wine-producing region in the world. The typical Wineaholic & More also carries more
        than 2,500 beers, from Americaâ€˜s most popular brands to hard-to-find microbrews and imports, and more than 3,000
        different spirits in every style and price range.
        <br>
        We're also committed to having the lowest prices on wine, spirits and beer every day. Our tremendous buying
        power and special relationships with producers, importers and wholesalers bring us considerable savings, which
        we pass on to our customers.<br>
        It's our Team Members who make the Wineaholic & More shopping experience so special. Wineaholic & More employs
        more than 4,000 dedicated men and women, including 600 wine service team members and 50 of our most
        knowledgeable wine experts, the Wineaholic Professionals. All of our wine team members participate in extensive
        training programs, weekly team wine tastings and monthly wine-producer seminars. Many travel to winemaking
        regions to meet our producers and learn about their wines firsthand.

    <p>The goal is to ensure each customer has an exceptional wine-buying experience. Do you need an expert
        recommendation for a wine? Or do you know what you want, and just need directions to the right aisle? Whether
        you are new to the world of wine or a great wine enthusiast, we want all our customers to be confident and
        comfortable exploring our stores and selecting the wines they prefer. That's the Wineaholic Experience.
